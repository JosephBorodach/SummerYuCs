			<h2>Where we're coming from</h2>
		    <p>We were born and raised on the farm land of Teaneck, fed from its very ground and milked by its very people.</p><br/>
			<div id="intros">
			    <p>Hello! Yosef Borodach here,</p>
		    	<div id="intro-content"><i> 
		    		<p>Over the last 20 years while we grew up in Teaneck, the town had just about everything one could want for their family: A strong, upright, but also diverse community, freindly folks, a shul for each child, fantastic sports leagues for kids, and so much more. </p>
					<p> So what was missing? From the time I was a young boy, I did so many of the classic old jobs accesible to kids and teens: Shoveling snow, building sukkahs, tutoring, ect. I greatly enjoyed these odd jobs because I was doing them for the wonderful people of my community. And, it was also quite profitable ;)</p>
				   	<p> However, my struggle was always the same: How do I find clients in such a big and competative world? In contrast to the huge platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Craig's List, where small buisnesses drown, Teaneck Shuls provided me a safe place where my services were not only wanted, but sought for.</p>
				   	<p> And with that, I present to you our community's website: A place where Teaneck Jews can <b>safely</b> unite and communicate, do buisness, and most importantly, perform acts of kindness.</p>
				   	<p> Enjoy! </p>
